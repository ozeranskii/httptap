# Query filters to suppress false positives

  - exclude:
      id: py/insecure-protocol
      # Reason: httptap is a diagnostic tool that needs to connect to legacy servers
      # with old TLS versions (TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1) for troubleshooting purposes.
      # This is NOT a security issue because:
      # 1. httptap does not transmit sensitive data in production
      # 2. The tool is designed to INSPECT TLS connections, not secure them
      # 3. Rejecting old TLS would make the tool useless for diagnosing legacy systems
      # See SECURITY.md "TLS Protocol Versions" section for detailed explanation.
